// parabola sampled off stateT the way jump/uppercut/knockback's own

// other hit still uses. See takeDamage far below: `kind === "uppercut"` is
// now the ONLY thing that routes into applyJuggleLaunch() instead of the
// plain setState("hitstun") branch - so there is no remaining case where a
// connecting uppercut still produces the old grounded reaction; every
// uppercut hit, fresh anti-air opener or a follow-up landed while the

// all. A juggled fighter staying exactly where they were launched from is

// sheet instead), so that cosmetic split isn't reproduced here: airKick is

// updateProjectiles loop (same array the bolt/rat-rush already live in)
// rather than a second parallel projectile system. Only the move DATA (cost/
// damage, same convention every other move constant in this file follows)
// lives here.
//
// No cast animation of its own - adding a new pose here would hit the exact
// problem airborneT was built to avoid: jumpOffset only samples a real
// height for "jump"/"airKick" (see that getter below), so transitioning into
// any OTHER state mid-flight would snap the sprite to ground level for the
// pose's duration, then jump back up once "jump" resumed - an obvious
// visual teleport. Instead this fires instantly off a buffered/justPressed
// special input while this.state === "jump" (see the combined jump/airKick
// branch of update() below) - this.state never changes, so jumpOffset keeps
// reading the same continuous flight arc it already was, and only
// lastEvent ("air-special-release") signals game.js to actually spawn the
// projectile that frame. Same "no windup, pure resource commitment" shape
// DASH already uses on the ground.
//
// Gated on this.state === "jump" specifically, not "airKick" too - that's
// already a committed 16-frame melee swing of its own (see AIR_ATTACK.

// the middle of one would need its own cancel-window reasoning this phase
// doesn't need to take on. A player gets one aerial special OR one aerial
// melee swing per airborne beat, same as a grounded fighter only ever
// commits to one grounded attack at a time.
//
// cost (30) sits between AIR_ATTACK's 18 and the grounded SPECIAL's 50 -
// real commitment (thrown from the air, where a whiff leaves no ground under
// you either), but this move's actual power is the TRACKING (can't be juked
// by ordinary positioning the way a straight-line bolt can, and - unlike
// every other grounded ranged attack - can reach an already-juggled
// defender at all) rather than a bigger number, so it doesn't need to cost
// as much as the multi-pulse grounded special to stay balanced.
//
// damage (14) is a SINGLE hit, deliberately not routed through the bolt/rat-
// rush's own multi-pulse flurry (game.js) - a homing juggle-extender that
// also landed 3 pulses per cast would trivially blow through
// MAX_JUGGLE_HITS in one throw, exactly the kind of exploit the launcher
// phase's whole anti-infinite design worked to prevent. Sized between

// --- Cancel windows: move-specific "special cancel" routes -----------------
// Replaces the old rule where ANY attack connecting while the defender was
// still hitstun/knockback-locked counted as a combo continuation, with zero
// regard for which move the ATTACKER threw or in what order (see
// takeDamage's wasChaining check far below in this file - that's still
// exactly how a landed hit gets SCORED as a combo continuation once it
// lands; nothing here touches that). This section is entirely about whether
// the ATTACKER is even allowed to throw the next move early enough to land
// it in the first place. Classic Street Fighter/King of Fighters "special
// cancel": each grounded attack gets a short window LATE in its own
// recovery (after its active hitbox frames, near the very end of the move,
// not the instant recovery starts) during which a specific, limited
// follow-up input cuts the rest of that recovery short and starts the next
// move immediately - see update()'s attack-state branch below for where
// this actually gets checked, right before the plain
// `if (this.stateT >= durations[this.state]) this.setState("idle")`
// fallback that's still the only way out of a move for anything NOT in this
// graph (or anything whose input didn't land inside the window).
//
// The route graph (deliberately small, not "everything cancels into
// everything" - that would just be the old bug with extra steps):
//   punch    -> uppercut, kick   the "jab into launcher" opener; a punch is
//                                 the one move plain enough to lead into
//                                 either a bigger strike (uppercut) or a
//                                 height-varied follow-up (kick)
//   kick     -> uppercut         kick, the HIGH starter, sets up the same
//                                 anti-air-shaped launcher a punch can
//   slide    -> uppercut         slide, the LOW starter, converges on the
//                                 exact same launcher route kick does - see
//                                 takeDamage's high/low guard mixup below for
//                                 why these two are the deliberate high/low
//                                 pair

//                                 not a step to cancel out of
// Notably absent: punch->punch and kick->kick. Repeating the exact same move
// never appears as its own target anywhere in this graph - mashing one
// button can still land two separate, real-gap-recovered pokes if the
// timing genuinely allows it (unchanged, self-limiting via hitstun/combo

// tapping it right as the hit lands - not just holding it through the whole
// exchange, which is what keeps a turtling "hold block forever" player from
// ever seeing this trigger and makes it a real timing read instead of a
// strictly-better version of plain block.
//
// 8 frames (~133ms at 60fps): PUNCH's activeStart is 6 frames into its own
// wind-up and KICK's is 10 - both clear this window with margin if the
// defender raises block only once the swing is visibly already committed,

// only, whiffed clean by a crouching profile before this even runs, see
// checkHit's own crouch/blockLow check in game.js) and slide ("low" - stops
// the new crouching guard only). Slide used to blow straight through block
// unconditionally, full stop - a crouching guard genuinely stopping it (for
// chip damage, same as every other block) is exactly the low half of this
// mixup; jumping it still works too, untouched. See update()'s crouch+block
// branch below for how "blockLow" is entered, and takeDamage's block gate
